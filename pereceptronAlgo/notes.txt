Perceptron & Choosing ML Algorithm
==============================

1️⃣ Perceptron – Brief Summary
------------------------------
- Type: Linear classifier (binary classification)
- Goal: Find a hyperplane that separates two classes.
- Model:
  y_hat = 1 if w^T x + b >= 0, else 0
- Training:
  Update weights when prediction is wrong:
    w := w + eta * (y - y_hat) * x
    b := b + eta * (y - y_hat)
- Converges only if data is linearly separable.

2️⃣ When to Use Perceptron
--------------------------
✅ Use it when:
1. Binary classification problem
2. Data is linearly separable (or roughly separable)
3. Simple and interpretable model is sufficient
4. Small to medium dataset

❌ Avoid when:
- Classes overlap heavily (non-linear)
- Output is continuous (use regression)
- Complex interactions (use trees, SVM, or neural networks)

3️⃣ How to Check if Data Fits Perceptron
----------------------------------------
1. Visual check (if 2D/3D): see if a straight line separates classes
2. Train a perceptron and check accuracy:
   - High accuracy (~100%) → good fit
   - Low accuracy → not suitable, try another algorithm
3. Theoretical check using linear programming (advanced)

4️⃣ How to Choose an ML Algorithm
---------------------------------
1. Identify task type:
   - Classification → labels are categories
   - Regression → labels are continuous numbers
2. Check linearity/separability:
   - Linearly separable → Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM
   - Non-linear → Decision Trees, Random Forest, Kernel SVM, Neural Networks
3. Consider data size & feature types:
   - Few samples → simple models
   - Many features → regularization or tree-based models
4. Try multiple models & evaluate using cross-validation
5. Pick the best model → tune hyperparameters → retrain

5️⃣ Rule of Thumb
-----------------
- Perceptron = linear, simple, fast, only for separable data
- Other algorithms = choose based on task, feature types, data size, and complexity
