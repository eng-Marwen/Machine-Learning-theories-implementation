1️⃣ Linear Regression

Use it when your target (dependent variable) is continuous, i.e., it can take any real number.

Examples:

Predicting house prices.

Predicting temperature.

Predicting student scores.

Model output: A real number (can be negative or positive, decimal allowed).

2️⃣ Logistic Regression (classification)

Use it when your target is categorical, usually binary (0 or 1), but it can also be multi-class with extensions.

Examples:

Predicting if an email is spam (yes/no → 1/0).

Predicting if a patient has a disease (yes/no).

Predicting if a customer will buy a product (yes/no).

Model output: A probability between 0 and 1 (then thresholded to decide class).
