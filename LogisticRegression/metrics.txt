For binary classification:

	               | Predicted Spam	     |   Predicted Not Spam
-------------------|---------------------|------------------------
Actual Spam	       |TP (True Positive)	 |  FN (False Negative)
-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------
Actual Not Spam	   |FP (False Positive)	 |  TN (True Negative)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

TP: spam correctly detected

TN: normal message correctly allowed

FP: normal message marked as spam ❌

FN: spam allowed through ❌

All metrics come from this table.

2️⃣ Accuracy

“How many predictions were correct overall?”

Formula:
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

Rule:

✅ Good when classes are balanced

❌ Misleading when data is imbalanced

📌 In spam detection → don’t trust accuracy alone

3️⃣ Precision

“When the model predicts spam, how often is it right?”

Formula:
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

Rule:

High precision → few false alarms

Important when FP is costly

📌 Example:

Email marked spam but is important → BAD
4️⃣ Recall (Sensitivity)

“How much spam did the model catch?”

Formula:
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

Rule:

High recall → few missed spam

Important when FN is costly

📌 Example:

Spam reaches inbox → BAD

6️⃣ F1-Score

Balance between precision and recall

Formula:
F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

Rule:

Best single metric for imbalanced data

Penalizes extreme values

📌 If one is low → F1 is low

7️⃣ Support

Number of real samples per class

Rule:

Shows class imbalance

Low support → metrics are less reliable

📌 Always check support first

8️⃣ Macro Average

Treats all classes equally

Formula:
Macro = average(metric for each class)

Rule:

Best to judge fairness across classes

Not affected by imbalance

📌 Use macro F1 when classes are imbalanced

8️⃣ Macro Average

Treats all classes equally
Macro = average(metric for each class)
Rule:
Best to judge fairness across classes

Not affected by imbalance

📌 Use macro F1 when classes are imbalanced

9️⃣ Weighted Average
Weights metrics by number of samples

Rule:
Dominated by majority class

Can hide poor minority performance

📌 Looks good, but can be misleading

1️⃣2️⃣ Interpreting YOUR results (example)

From your model:

Accuracy ≈ 96% → looks good

Spam Recall ≈ 95% → excellent

Not-spam Precision ≈ 68% → warning ⚠️

Macro F1 ≈ 0.89 → honest score
