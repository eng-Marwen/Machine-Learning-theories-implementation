This repository contains implementations of fundamental Machine Learning algorithms from scratch, using Python, without relying on high-level ML libraries (such as scikit-learn) for the core logic.

The goal of this project is learning and understanding how ML algorithms work internally, rather than achieving maximum performance.
## Algorithms Implemented

### 🔹 Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes

### 🔹 Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### 🔹 Others
- Gradient Descent
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Data Preprocessing (Normalization, Standardization)
